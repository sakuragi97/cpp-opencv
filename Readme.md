# OpenCV C++ Projects with Qt Framework

Repository of OpenCV projects implemented in C++ with the Qt framework. This collection of projects is inspired by the book "OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook" by Robert LaganiÃ¨re. Each project provides practical examples to beter understand computer vision concepts and enhance your skills.

## Projects

### 1. Playing with Images

Explore basic image loading, display, and manipulation using OpenCV.

### 2. Manipulating the Pixels

Learn pixel-level operations to manipulate image data.

### 3. Processing Images with Classes

Organize image processing functionality into classes for modularity.

### 4. Counting Pixels with Histograms

Utilize histograms to analyze and count pixel values in images.

### 5. Transforming Images with Morphological Operations

Apply morphological operations for image transformations.

### 6. Filtering the Images

Implement various filters for smoothing and enhancing images.

### 7. Extracting Lines, Contours, and Components

Identify and extract lines, contours, and connected components.

### 8. Detecting and Matching Interest Points

Implement algorithms to detect and match interest points in images.

### 9. Estimating Projective Relations in Images

Explore projective transformations and their applications.

### 10. Processing Video Sequences

Extend your skills to process video sequences and apply computer vision techniques in real-time.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Make sure you have OpenCV and Qt installed on your system.
   - `OpenCV version 4.8.0`
   - `Qt version 5.15.12 MinGW 32-bit`
   - To link OpenCV with Qt projects you can check this video [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KNh_7fUqrM)

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakuragi97/cpp-opencv.git
   cd cpp-opencv
   ```

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Use Qt Creator to build and run the projects.
   - Navigate to the specific project folder.
   - The projects are sepereted as different main windows, you can choose the project based on the main window on the `main.cpp`

4. **Explore and Learn:**
   - I used comments sections to split different tasks
   - Delve into the source code, experiment, and modify as you learn.

**Note:** The main purpose of this repository was to free practice and implement different OpenCV tasks with C++ for my self-learning. Please feel free to use the code, but I can't promise support or free-code-bugs.
